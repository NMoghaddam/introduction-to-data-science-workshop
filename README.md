# Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series

Teaching materials for KAUST Visualization Core Lab (KVL) _Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series_. 

## Course Curricula

### Identifying Core Competencies for Data Science 

According to a recent Oâ€™Reilly Data Science Survey, most data scientists use multiple programming 
languages on a daily basis to solve their data science problems. The top three programming 
languages used by data scientists are SQL, Python, and Bash. The ability to share and reproduce 
data science workflows is critical, whether the workflows are providing decision support in 
industrial applications, or generating novel insights from scientific data. Core tools for 
facilitating reproducible data science workflows are version control tools such as Git, virtual 
environment tools such as Conda, and container technologies such as Docker.

### Building Data Science Capacity at KAUST

KVL has organized a series of Introduction to Data Science workshops to build capacity in the core 
data science tools and enable future data science applications at KAUST.

* Introduction to Python for Data Science
* Introduction to R for Data Science
* Introduction to Conda for (Data) Scientists
* Introduction to Shell for (Data) Scientists
* Introduction to Version Control using Git for (Data) Scientists
* Introduction to SQL for Data Science
* Introduction to Docker for (Data) Scientists

The core workshop material largely follows a curriculum developed by Software and Data Carpentry, 
two global nonprofit organizations that teach foundational coding and data science skills to 
researchers worldwide. The curriculum will be offered every Fall and Spring semester in its 
entirety in order to provide KAUST students, post-docs, staff, and researchers with an opportunity 
to develop their skills in these core data science tools. 

KAUST Core Labs will offer a Certificate of Completion to those learners who complete the core 
Introduction to Data Science curriculum.

### Helping to Advance the State-of-the-Art in Data Science at KAUST 

In addition to building capacity in core data science tools, KVL and KAUST Supercomputing Core Laboratory (KSL) are planning to offer additional advanced training courses in tools used in state-of-the-art data science applications with a particular focus on enabling data science with GPUs.

## Using Docker

In order to build Docker images for your project and run containers you will need to 
install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Detailed instructions for using Docker to build and image and launch containers can 
be found in the `docker/README.md`.
